# IoT-Based Pet Feeder

An IoT-based pet feeder is a project that combines technology and pets, allowing you to keep your furry friend well-fed even when you're not around. This project involves building an automatic pet feeder that dispenses food at a set time, using a NodeMCU ESP8266 for the controller, a servo motor for the opening and closing mechanism, a 16x2 LCD for time display, and an LCD I2C module.

## Project Overview

The IoT-based pet feeder is a DIY project that involves building an automatic pet feeder that dispenses food at a set time. The system consists of a NodeMCU ESP8266, which serves as the controller, a servo motor that operates the opening and closing mechanism, a 16x2 LCD for displaying the time, and an LCD I2C module.

The system is designed to be easy to use and can be controlled remotely using a mobile app. The mobile app allows you to set the feeding schedule, monitor your pet's feeding behavior, and even dispense food manually.

## Project Requirements

To build an IoT-based pet feeder, you will need the following components:

- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Servo motor
- 16x2 LCD
- LCD I2C module
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Power supply
- Pet food container

## Project Setup

1. Connect the NodeMCU ESP8266 to the breadboard and power it up.
2. Connect the servo motor to the breadboard and the NodeMCU ESP8266.
3. Connect the 16x2 LCD to the breadboard and the NodeMCU ESP8266.
4. Connect the LCD I2C module to the breadboard and the NodeMCU ESP8266.
5. Connect the pet food container to the servo motor.
6. Write the code and upload it to the NodeMCU ESP8266.

## Project Features

The IoT-based pet feeder has the following features:

- Automatic feeding at a set time
- Remote control via mobile app
- Manual feeding option
- Feeding schedule customization
- Feeding behavior monitoring
- Low food level alert

## Project Tutorial

You can find a detailed tutorial on how to build the IoT-based pet feeder on YouTube. The tutorial covers the following topics:

- Setting up the NodeMCU ESP8266
- Connecting the servo motor, 16x2 LCD, and LCD I2C module to the NodeMCU ESP8266
- Writing and uploading the code to the NodeMCU ESP8266
- Testing the pet feeder

## Conclusion

Building an IoT-based pet feeder is a fun and practical project that can improve the quality of life for your pet. By combining technology and pets, you can create a system that allows you to keep your furry friend well-fed even when you're not around. With the features like remote control and feeding behavior monitoring, you can have peace of mind knowing that your pet is getting the care it needs. Good luck with your project!
